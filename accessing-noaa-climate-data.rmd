1. Browse to the data site. The URL is <http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/selectlocation>.
1. Under "Select a Dataset", choose "Normals Monthly".
1. Under "Select a Location Type" choose "County".
1. Under "Select a State" choose "Oregon"

Now you will need to do this next part 36 times, once for each county. The returned datasets aren't tagged by county, although they *are* geotagged and could be tagged in a GIS.

I'll run through the process for Baker county.

1. Select a county. A brown "ADD LOCATION TO CART" button will appear. Press it. It will turn grey and you'll see an item in the cart.
1. Press the brown "Cart" button at the upper right to proceed to the next step.
1. Select "Custom Monthly Normals CSV" in the "Select the Output Format" panel.
1. The full date range should be pre-selected. If it isn't, select the year "2010" and all twelve months.
1. Press the brown "CONTINUE" button at the bottom.
1. For "Station Detail & Data Flag Options", select "Station name" and "Geographic location".
1. Under "Select data types for custom output", click the "Select all" link on the upper right of the panel.
1. Press the brown "CONTINUE" button at the bottom.
1. On the final page, enter your email address at the bottom. Check the "Remember my email address" and press the brown "SUBMIT ORDER" button. The site will email you a confirmation of the order and a link to the dataset when processing is done.
